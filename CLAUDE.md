# CLAUDE.md — Project AI Rules (Token-Optimized)

## 🔴 PRIME DIRECTIVE
Every token costs money and latency. Default to the **minimum viable response**
that fully solves the task. Verbosity is a bug.

---

## RESPONSE FORMAT

### Never do this
- Do not restate the question or task
- Do not explain what you're about to do — just do it
- Do not add "Great question!", "Sure!", "Certainly!", "Of course!" or any affirmation
- Do not write closing remarks like "Let me know if you need anything else" or "Hope that helps!"
- Do not summarize what you just did after doing it
- Do not add disclaimers unless they are critical to correctness
- Banned filler: "it's worth noting", "as mentioned", "keep in mind", "importantly", "essentially", "basically", "simply"

### Always do this
- Start the response with the answer or the code
- Use the most compressed format that preserves full meaning
- Prefer code over prose when both convey the same information
- Inline comments inside code > paragraph explanations outside code

---

## CODE OUTPUT RULES

### Diffs over full files
When editing existing code, output **only the changed sections** using this format:

```
// FILE: src/utils/parser.ts
// REPLACE: lines 42–67
<new code block>
```

Never rewrite an entire file when only a function changed. Exception: if the
file is < 30 lines or the user explicitly asks for the full file.

### No scaffolding padding
- Omit boilerplate the user can generate (`npx create-next-app` output)
- Skip `console.log("starting...")` style debug lines unless debugging is the task
- Omit example usage blocks unless the API is non-obvious

### Skeleton comments instead of repeated code
When a pattern repeats, write it once and use a comment:

```ts
// Same pattern for updateUser, deleteUser, listUsers
async function createUser(data: UserInput) { ... }
```

### Import blocks — only what's new
Only show import lines that are being added or changed. Do not reprint
existing unchanged imports.

---

## TOOL-CALL & AGENT-MODE DISCIPLINE

This is the largest hidden cost in modern AI IDEs. Tool-call results get
piped back into context — a single `read_file` of a 2,000-line file can cost
more than the entire response.

### Reads & searches
- **Never re-read a file you already read this session.** Treat reads as cached.
- **Never list a directory you already listed.**
- **Batch independent reads into a single message.** Parallel beats serial.
- Prefer exact-string `grep` over semantic search when you know the symbol.
- For files > 500 lines, use targeted reads (offset/limit) — never read the whole file just to find one function.

### Plan, then act
For non-trivial tasks, sketch the plan in 1–2 lines internally before issuing
tool calls. For trivial tasks, just act.

### Don't speculatively explore
If the user gave you a file path, start there. If the user gave you an error,
search for the error string. Only widen if the targeted approach failed.

### Build / test / lint discipline
- Don't run a full test suite to verify a one-line typo fix.
- Don't run repo-wide type-checks/lints after touching one file.
- Run targeted checks on the changed file only.
- If the user didn't ask you to run tests, don't run them.

### Stop when done
- When the requested change is in place, stop.
- Don't run extra verification "for safety".
- Don't write a summary the user can already see in the diff.

---

## CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

### What to include in every request (user responsibility)
1. **File path** of the file being modified
2. **Exact function/class name** if targeting a specific block
3. **Error message verbatim** if fixing a bug (not a paraphrase)
4. **Expected vs actual** behavior for bugs

### What NOT to paste into context
- Entire files when only a function is relevant
- `package.json` unless the issue is dependency-related
- Lock files (`yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json`) — never
- Generated files (`.next/`, `dist/`, `build/`)
- Files > 200 lines unless the entire file is the subject

### Chunking large tasks
For tasks touching 3+ files, break into sub-tasks. Ask for one file at a time.
Do not request a full-project refactor in a single prompt.

## EXPLANATION POLICY

| Task type        | Explanation style                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bug fix          | 1-line cause + fix. No history lesson.                         |
| New feature      | Inline comments only. No external prose.                       |
| Refactor         | State the pattern (e.g., "Extract service layer"). No essay.   |
| Architecture     | Bullet list, max 5 items. No paragraphs.                       |
| Debugging help   | Next step only. Not a tutorial.                                |

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO REJECT

When asked to generate the following, push back and ask for a scoped version:
- "Refactor the entire codebase"
- "Add comments to every file"
- "Rewrite everything in TypeScript"
- "Make it production-ready" (too vague)
- "Generate all the CRUD for this model" without a schema

Instead, ask: _"Which file/endpoint first?"_

---

## LANGUAGE & STYLE

- Use the same language/framework already in the file being edited
- Match existing naming conventions — do not rename things unless asked
- Match existing quote style, semicolon usage, indentation
- Do not introduce new dependencies without flagging: `// requires: zod`

---

## MODEL SELECTION (cost lever the user controls)

Pick the cheapest model that does the job. Suggested defaults:

| Task                                          | Suggested model tier            |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Single-file edit, tight scope, clear pattern  | Fast / small model              |
| Multi-file refactor or new feature            | Mid-tier reasoning model        |
| Architecture, debugging, novel problem        | Top-tier reasoning model        |
| "Just answer this question"                   | Fast / small model              |

Don't burn a top-tier model on a typo fix. Don't use a fast model on a
multi-system architecture decision.

---

## PROMPT-CACHE AWARENESS

If your tool supports prompt caching (Claude, Cursor, etc.):
- Keep this `CLAUDE.md` and the project's `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` stable across sessions — they cache.
- Put **stable, reusable** content (rules, project notes, architecture) at the **top** of context.
- Put **task-specific** content (current bug, current file) at the **bottom**.
- Avoid casually editing rule files — every edit invalidates the cache.

---

## ERROR & DEBUG WORKFLOW

1. Read the error message fully before responding.
2. Identify the **single most likely cause** first.
3. Propose one fix, not three alternatives.
4. If uncertain, ask one targeted clarifying question — not a list of five.

---

## PLANNING & DESIGN

When asked to design or plan:
- Use **pseudocode or schema first**, not prose
- Max 3 options when presenting alternatives — not 7
- State a recommendation, don't just list tradeoffs
- Use a table for comparisons, not paragraphs

---

## TOKEN BUDGET REFERENCE

| Output type             | Target token range            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Bug fix (simple)        | 50–150 tokens                 |
| Bug fix (complex)       | 150–400 tokens                |
| New function            | 100–300 tokens                |
| New module/file         | 300–800 tokens                |
| Architecture plan       | 200–500 tokens                |
| Full file rewrite       | Only when explicitly requested|

If a response exceeds 800 tokens, pause and ask: _"Is all of this necessary?"_

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC NOTES

### Stack
- Language: TypeScript / SQL
- Framework: Quasar v2 (Vue 3, Vite)
- Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- Auth: Supabase Auth (PKCE flow, Google OAuth)
- Infra: Cloudflare Pages (Frontend)

### Conventions
- State management pattern: Pinia (modular stores)
- API layer pattern: Supabase Client SDK / RPCs
- File naming convention: camelCase for code, kebab-case for assets
- User feedback: always use `web/src/composables/useFeedback.ts` (`showApiError` / `showError` dialog for failures; `showSuccess` / `showInfo` / `showWarning` top toasts). Do not use ad-hoc `$q.notify` / custom error dialogs in new features. See `.cursor/rules/feedback-notifications.mdc`.
